### Sample Projects that use pickett

### Sample1

* Sample1 has two executables, [wuclient](https://github.com/pebbe/zmq4/blob/master/examples/wuclient.go) and [wuserver](https://github.com/pebbe/zmq4/blob/master/examples/wuserver.go) that are taken from the [ZMQ Documentation](http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all).  Because it is necessary to have libmzq installed on the system to link and run these executables, this example demonstrates a more complex setup than a "vanilla" go-based system.
