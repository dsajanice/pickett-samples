// This is an example Pickett.json file for the sample1 programs.  

// The sample1 programs are an exmaple from the zeromq documentation, that runs a client 
// and server (sub and pub, respectively) that receives/sends bogus weather data.
//
// The connectivity is supplied by zeromq which gets installed (libzmq) in the 'sample1/runner'
// image; the go language bindings are from github.com/pebbe/zeromq4 and are installed
// in the 'sample1/external' image.  
//
// When run, the client connects to the server via TCP and selects a zipcode that it
// wants to listen for information about.
