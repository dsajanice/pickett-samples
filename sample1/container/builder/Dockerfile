## The objective here is to create our build tools. We end up re-downloading the
## build-essential and curl tools because these are not supposed to exist on the
## selma/runner container.
##
## The pickett side assumes that go is installed and the GOPATH and PATH set 
## correctly if you invoke a GoBuild in a container.
